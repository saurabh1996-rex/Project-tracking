## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project I was able to gain more understanding in the concept of flexbox and also implement them effectively inorder to bring the design to life. I was also tracking the speed that I'd agin while doing this and I'm glad that it's getting better for me. I'll be focusing even more on the time management and complete the projects as quickly as possible.

### Continued development

I'll be focusing more on the psuedo elements and also the border property inorder to make shapes on elements which could make the design cooler. Animations will also be in focus.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has been my first line of contact when I was stuck at stages. It usually solved all my quests.
